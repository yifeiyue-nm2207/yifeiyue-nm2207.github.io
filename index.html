        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
			Social media has become an increasingly popular tool for communication and self-expression, but
			research has also suggested that excessive social media use can have negative effects on mental
			health. Studies have found links between high levels of social media use and increased rates of
			anxiety, depression, and loneliness, as well as poor sleep quality, low self-esteem, and social
			comparison. While not all social media use is harmful, it's important for individuals to be mindful
			of their social media habits and the potential impact on their mental health.
		</p>
		<p>
			Based on the aforementioned background, it's clear that there is a need for further exploration of
			the relationship between social media usage and mental health. This is where data visualization comes
			in as a powerful tool for presenting complex information in a way that is easy to understand and interpret.
			By analyzing survey data related to social media use and mental health, we can gain a deeper understanding
			of the potential effects of social media on mental health and wellbeing. The data visualization section of
			this website will present the findings of the survey data, using various visualization techniques to highlight
			key patterns and trends in the data.
