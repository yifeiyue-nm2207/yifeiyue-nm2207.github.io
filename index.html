        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
			Social media has become an increasingly popular tool for communication and self-expression, but
			research has also suggested that excessive social media use can have negative effects on mental
			health. Studies have found links between high levels of social media use and increased rates of
			anxiety, depression, and loneliness, as well as poor sleep quality, low self-esteem, and social
			comparison. While not all social media use is harmful, it's important for individuals to be mindful
			of their social media habits and the potential impact on their mental health.
		</p>

		<p>
			Based on the aforementioned background, it's clear that there is a need for further exploration of
			the relationship between social media usage and mental health. This is where data visualization comes
			in as a powerful tool for presenting complex information in a way that is easy to understand and interpret.
			By analyzing survey data related to social media use and mental health, we can gain a deeper understanding
			of the potential effects of social media on mental health and wellbeing. The data visualization section of
			this website will present the findings of the survey data, using various visualization techniques to highlight
			key patterns and trends in the data.

        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>Let's look at the impact of using social media or not, here are some survey data from a survey</p>
		<div id="canvas-pie">
			<canvas id="pie"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>As we can see, most of the people (472 out of 475) who finished the survey are social media users, and only 3 people are non-social media users.</p>
		<div id="canvas-container">
			<canvas id="my_chart_1" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			It is evident that there is a correlation between social media usage and sleep problems. More than half of the
			people who use social media rate their sleep problems as 3 or higher on a scale of 0-5. This suggests that there
			may be a negative impact of social media on sleep quality. It is important to note, however, that this is a
			correlation and not necessarily a causal relationship, and further research may be necessary to establish causality.
			Nonetheless, these findings highlight the importance of maintaining healthy social media habits and prioritizing
			quality sleep.
		</p>
		<div id="canvas-container">
			<canvas id="my_chart_2" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			It can be concluded that social media usage is strongly associated with distraction. More than half of the respondents
			who reported using social media also reported high levels of distractibility, rating themselves at 3 or higher on a scale
			of 0-5. This finding highlights the potential negative impact of social media on individuals' ability to concentrate and
			focus on tasks.
		</p>
		<div id="canvas-container">
			<canvas id="my_chart_3" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>
			it appears that individuals who use social media are more likely to report difficulty with concentration. Over half of
			the individuals in the dataset rated their difficulty with concentration at 3 or higher on a scale of 0-5.
		</p>
      </section>
      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
			Although it is clear from the current analysis that using social media can have detrimental effects on a person's mental
			health, my exploration of the dataset is still somewhat limited. Therefore, I will continue to analyze whether there are
			differences in the level of impact between men and women, young people, middle-aged people, and older people, as well as
			between single and non-single individuals, and whether there are differences in the results based on the frequency of social
			media use. I will also use more interesting visualization techniques and new graphics to illustrate this information in the
			future.
